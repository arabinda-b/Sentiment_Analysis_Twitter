## Overview
In this hands-on project, I trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews.


## Project details 
- Applied python libraries to import and visualize dataset
- Performed text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
- Performed exploratory data analysis and plotted word-cloud
- Performed tokenization to tweet text using Scikit Learn's CountVectorization
- Explored the difference between prior probability, posterior probability and likelihood in Naïve Bayes classifiers
- Trained Naïve Bayes classifier models using Scikit-Learn to preform classification
- Evaluated the performance of trained Naïve Bayes Classifier model using confusion matrices.
